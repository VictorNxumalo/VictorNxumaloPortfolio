the HTML includes Bootstrap, which suggests a responsive design using Bootstrap's grid system. The navbar is set up with Bootstrap classes like `navbar-expand-lg` and `container-fluid`, so it's mobile-friendly. The links in the navbar use the font "Space Mono, serif" with a dark color (#2C3E50) and turn gold (#F39C12) on hover. That's a key part of the theme—dark and gold colors.

Looking at the CSS, there's a lot of custom styling. The `styled-hr` class uses a gradient from gold to dark blue, which reinforces the color scheme. Headings like `.section-heading` are uppercase with letter spacing, giving them a modern, clean look. The typography mainly uses 'Space Mono' for headings and buttons, which is a monospace font, and 'Montserrat' from Google Fonts for other text. Wait, in the HTML's head, there are multiple Google Fonts links including Montserrat, Playwrite VN, and Space Mono. But in the CSS, the body font is set to 'Roboto'? Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. The user might have intended Montserrat as the main font since it's included in the HTML.

The color scheme seems to revolve around #2C3E50 (dark blue), #F39C12 (gold/orange), and #34495E (lighter dark blue). These colors are used consistently in buttons, hover effects, and accents. For example, the download button is styled with gold, and the navbar links turn gold on hover.

The website uses animations from AOS (Animate On Scroll) for fade-ins and other effects when scrolling. There are also Lottie animations for the loading screen and interactive elements, adding a modern, dynamic feel. Cards have shadow effects and hover animations like scaling up, which makes the UI feel interactive.

In the CSS, the `.service-card` and `.certification-img` classes have hover effects with scaling and shadow changes, emphasizing interactivity. The typography for blockquotes includes a transition where an image of Steve Jobs appears on hover, which is a creative touch.

I notice some inconsistencies. For instance, the CSS mentions 'Roboto' as the body font, but the HTML links 'Montserrat' and 'Space Mono'. Maybe the user intended to use Montserrat but forgot to update the CSS. Also, there are multiple Google Fonts imports, which might affect loading times. The use of Bootstrap alongside custom CSS suggests a mix of framework reliability and personalized styling.

Overall, the design aims for a professional, modern look with a cohesive color scheme, responsive layout, and interactive elements. The typography combines monospace for headings (Space Mono) with sans-serif (Montserrat) for body text, creating a tech-oriented aesthetic. The gold and dark blue colors convey professionalism and warmth, suitable for a portfolio site.

Website Design Style & Typography Analysis

Body Text:

Font: Montserrat (sans-serif) for readability.

Style: Medium weight with line height (1.6) for clarity.

Quotes & Accents:

Aguafina Script or Playwrite VN (visible in HTML font links) for decorative flair.

3. Visual Style
Animations:

AOS Library: Fade-ins/zoom effects on scroll for sections.

Lottie Animations: Loading screen and interactive icons for dynamism.

Interactive Elements:

Hover effects on cards (scale-up, shadow intensification).

Gradient HR lines (gold → dark blue) and circular markers.

Layout:

Bootstrap grid for responsiveness.

Cards with soft shadows and rounded corners for structure.

4. Key Design Choices
Professionalism: Dark blue/gold palette conveys trust and expertise.

Tech Focus: Monospace fonts (Space Mono) and code snippets highlight technical skills.

User Experience: Smooth transitions, hover-triggered Steve Jobs image, and collapsible skill sections for engagement.

Inconsistencies to Address
Font Conflict: CSS references Roboto, but HTML loads Montserrat and Space Mono. Update CSS to use Montserrat for body text.

Performance: Multiple Google Fonts may slow loading. Consolidate font imports.

Image Optimization: Some images (e.g., a in project cards) have broken paths. Verify asset links.

Summary
Your design blends modern minimalism (Bootstrap grids, clean typography) with dynamic interactivity (animations, hover effects). The gold/dark blue theme and monospace fonts create a tech-savvy, professional identity, while Montserrat ensures readability. Refining font usage and image paths will polish the experience further.
